# Angular QuickStart - Starter

I recently took these 2 PluralSight courses:

https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/play-by-play-angular-2-app-deployment-azure-git-john-papa-shayne-boyer/table-of-contents

This is the combination of the 2 courses.

You need Node, Git Bash, and Visual Studio Code.

The npm commands are in the package.json.  From the folder you cloned into (in Git Bash).

execute:
npm build
npm start
